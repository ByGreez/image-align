        Forward-compositional image alignment.
        
        'Best' aligns a template image with a target image through minimization of the sum of 
        squared intensity errors between the warped target image and the template image with 
        respect to the warp parameters.
     
        This algorithm is a variant of the classic Lucas-Kanade version. Baker an Matthews 
        coined it the forward compositional, because of the way the incremental warp parameters
        are combined. Instead formulating the least squares equations by means of a parameter 
        delta that is added to the previous estimate:
     
            W(x, p) = W(x, p + delta)
     
        it is rewritten as the combination of two warps
        
            W(x, p) = W(x, p) * W(x, delta) = W(W(x, delta), p)
     
        where * is meant to be the composing operator (when dealing with planar motions, often
        a 3x3 matrix multiplication).
     
        This leads to three differences compared to the classic Lucas-Kanade algorithm
            - The Jacobian is evaluated at W(x, 0) and is thus constant that can be pre-computed for
              every pixel in the template.
            - The gradient is evaluated at the warped image. This is a somewhat subtle difference:
              in the classic version the gradient was evaluated on the original image and then
              warped.
            - The way the new warp is calculated is by composition rather than addition of parameters.
