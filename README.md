# About this library

**Image Align** is a tiny C++ library providing sample implementations of variants of the classic image alignment algorithm by Lucas-Kanade.

The project emerged while working on [AAM](https://www.github.com/cheind/aam), an active appearance models library. Fitting active appearance models is similar to the classic image alignment problem: fit a template image to given target image through optimizing a parametrized warp function in such a way that a given energy function, measuring the difference between the warped target image and the template image, is minimized. 

In AAMs the thoughtafter warp function is rather (piecewise affine transforms) complex and the fitting process involves estimation of more parameters than just the warp parameters. 

Therefore, I decided to start **Image Align** as a playground to study image alignment algorithms with the hope to get a better and cleaner picture of the mechanics of these algorithms. 
 
# Algorithms

All image alignment algorithms implemented in this library are based on the original formulation of [Lucas-Kanade](#Lucas81):

 - Forward additive algorithm
 - Forward compositional algorithm
 - Inverse compositional algorithm

The alignment algorithms are independent of the chosen warp function. Currently the library provides the following warp modes

 - 2D Translational Warp
 - 2D Euclidean Warp 
 - 2D Similarity Warp
 - 2D Affine Warp

# Building from source
**Image Alignment** requires the following pre-requisites

 - [CMake](www.cmake.org) - for generating cross platform build files
 - [OpenCV](www.opencv.org) - for image processing related functions 
 
To build from source

 1. Point CMake to the cloned git repository
 1. Click CMake Configure
 1. Point `OpenCV_DIR` to the directory containing the file `OpenCVConfig.cmake`
 1. Click CMake Generate
 
Although **Image Alignment** should build across multiple platforms and architectures, tests are carried out on these systems
 - Windows 8/10 MSVC10 x86
 - OS X 10.10 XCode 7.x

If the build should fail for a specific platform, don't hesitate to create an issue.
